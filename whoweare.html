    <h4><b>Member</b></h4>
    <p style="text-align:justify">GEN comprised more than 130 civil society organisations, national and international NGOs, and Technical Resource Persons working to bring about gender equality and the fulfilment of women's rights in Myanmar through: building the evidence base in the new emerging context in Myanmar; advocacy in national, regional and international forums; and innovations in communications; and capacity building initiatives. We believe that addressing gender inequality and respecting women's rights is critical to equitable and people-centred development, to building peace and democracy, and to meet the unique challenges and opportunities Myanmar faces today. Our membership is both inclusive and strategic: it encompasses members with a sound understanding of situations and needs at the grassroots level, and with access to information, expertise and opportunity. We are member-driven and member participation is essential to our work.</p><hr>
